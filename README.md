## Project Description

A Web application that gets the shortest route from point A to point B, using real-world map, Made for the Algorithms and Design Course, Bandung Insitute Of Technology. By Kenneth Ezekiel (13521089) and Michael Jonathan Halim (13521124). Solved using the Uniform-Cost Search and A* Search.

## Problem Description

The shortest path problem is a problem that: given a list of nodes with its neighbors/edges, finds the shortest path possible from point A to point B, with each edge containing a weight.

This project solves the problem with a web application, that uses a map API to input the nodes and edges, or a .json file containing the graph and nodes.
